# Roadmap & Ideas

| Status | Item | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | Core audio/video panes | Already implemented via `AudioSettingsElement` and `VideoSettingsElement`. |
| ✅ | PlayerPrefs persistence | Default save path with JSON fallback. |
| 🔜 | Additional categories | Add Gameplay/Input panes using the same `SettingsSectionElement` base class. |
| 🔜 | Input rebinding sample | Showcase how to embed the menu with the new Input System. |
| 💡 | Localized labels | Expose a label provider so buttons/sliders can be translated without duplicating the UXML. |
| 💡 | Runtime theme switcher | Let players swap USS themes from inside the menu rather than the docs theme toggle. |
